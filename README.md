# ShitcoinWC: ToiletPaper 🚽💩🧻

## 1. Introduction

### Overview

Welcome to the wild world of GSHT! If you've ever stared at your wallet full of underperforming, once-hyped tokens and thought, "What the flush am I supposed to do with these?", then you're in the right place. GSHT is here to turn your crypto trash into treasure with our innovative ShitcoinWC platform. It's like turning lead into gold, except smellier and way more profitable.

### Mission Statement

Our mission is simple: Clean up the crypto ecosystem, one shitcoin at a time. We envision a world where every sad, forgotten token gets a second chance to shine. With GSHT, we're not just flushing away the bad, we're recycling it into something valuable.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Market Pain Points

The crypto market is full of "diamonds in the rough" – and by diamonds, we mean heaps of underperforming shitcoins. According to a 2021 analysis by Coinopsy, there are over 1,000 dead coins – tokens that have lost all value and have no active development. These coins clutter your wallet, mocking your past investment decisions and taking up space.

Then there are the memecoins. Remember Dogecoin? Started as a joke, it skyrocketed to fame, proving that even the silliest ideas can have value – if you have enough memes and Elon Musk tweets backing you. But for every Dogecoin, there are countless other memecoins that crash and burn, leaving investors holding bags of worthless tokens.

### Our Solution

Enter GSHT and the ShitcoinWC platform. Think of us as the crypto ecosystem’s janitorial service, but way cooler. Here's how we turn your crypto woes into wins:

- **The Great Flush:** Users deposit their unwanted shitcoins into our smart contract. Think of it as Marie Kondo-ing your wallet – if it doesn't spark joy (or profits), it gets flushed. 🚽
- **Token Transformation:** We convert these forgotten tokens into GSHT, a valuable and versatile token that’s more useful than a plunger in a clogged toilet. 🔄
- **Rewards and Engagement:** By participating in the flush, users can earn bonuses, participate in community airdrops, and even contribute to our project’s development. 🎁

We're not just cleaning up; we're creating a sustainable ecosystem where every token has a purpose, and every user can benefit. Join us in this hilarious, rewarding journey as we make crypto fun, profitable, and cleaner than ever before!

## 3. Token Distribution

### Minting Tokens

Welcome to the GSHT token launch, where we turn your crypto woes into wins! We’re minting tokens to kick off the project, and here’s how we’re keeping it fair and flush-tastic for everyone – no team hoarding, no future headaches, just pure, unadulterated community power:

- **Wallet Bonus (30%)** 🎉
  - **Purpose:** To sprinkle bonuses during the shitcoin flush and boost tokens for buybacks.

  - **Purpose:** To tip our developer wizards who conjure up magical code improvements.
- **Wallet KOLs (5%)** 📢
  - **Purpose:** To reward our social media champions for spreading the GSHT gospel.

### Wallet Descriptions and Functions

#### Wallet Bonus

- **Description:** This wallet is our golden throne for doling out sweet bonuses during the grand shitcoin flush.
- **Function:**
  - Add a little extra love when shitcoins are flushed down the blockchain toilet. 🚽
  - Pump up the buybacked tokens, boosting GSHT's value like a stock on rocket fuel. 🚀

#### Wallet Liquidity

### Liquidity Allocation (40% of Initial Supply) 🌊

To ensure the stability and liquidity of GSHT, 40% of the initial token supply will be allocated to liquidity. This allocation will be divided into two main categories to maximize the efficiency and robustness of the liquidity pool:

#### 1. Liquidity Offering (20% of Initial Supply) 💰

The purpose of this allocation is to allow buyers to acquire tokens directly at market price and actively contribute to the liquidity pool.

**Function:**

- Facilitate the direct purchase of GSHT by users at market price. 💸
- Add an equivalent amount of GSHT to the liquidity pool, thereby increasing the available liquidity on trading platforms. 📈
- Stabilize the price of GSHT by ensuring a sufficient supply for transactions. ⚖️

#### 2. Flush Liquidity (20% of Initial Supply) 🔄

This portion of the liquidity is dedicated to buying BNB, adding GSHT, and continuously strengthening liquidity after each flush.

**Function:**

- Use funds to buy back BNB, ensuring a stable reserve of liquidity in Binance Coin. 💵
- Reinject GSHT into the liquidity pool to maintain an optimal level of liquidity after each flush event. 💧
- Strengthen the overall liquidity and stability of the GSHT market after each major transaction, ensuring a smooth trading experience for users. 🌐

By combining these two approaches, we ensure that GSHT liquidity is not only abundant but also well-managed, guaranteeing long-term stability and a rapid response to market fluctuations.

#### Wallet Community Airdrop

- **Description:** This wallet is the candy jar we open when the community hits major milestones.
- **Function:**
  - Hand out GSHT rewards to our awesome holders when we reach big goals. 🎯

## 4. Holders' Airdrop Tiers Table

To keep our community excited and engaged, we’ve set up a tiers system for holders' airdrops. Each tier represents a milestone in our Twitter follower count, and when we hit that milestone, our loyal holders get an airdrop of 1% of their holdings. It’s like a bonus for sticking with us and helping spread the GSHT gospel.

### Here’s how it works:

| Tier      | Reward          |
|-----------|------------------|
| 1,000     | 1% of holding    |
| 50,000    | 1% of holding    |
| 100,000   | 1% of holding    |
| 250,000   | 1% of holding    |
| 500,000   | 1% of holding    |
| 750,000   | 1% of holding    |
| 1,000,000 | 1% of holding    |
| 5,000,000 | 1% of holding    |
| 10,000,000| 1% of holding    |

### How It Works and Why It’s Good for the Project

**Why this is awesome:**

1. **Incentivizes Engagement:** The more you and the community engage and promote GSHT, the faster we reach those follower milestones and the more airdrops you get. 📈
2. **Builds Hype:** Who doesn’t love a good airdrop? It keeps the community buzzing, tweeting, and sharing. 🐦
